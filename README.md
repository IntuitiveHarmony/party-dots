# React-Dots

[Live Site](https://intuitiveharmony.github.io/react-dots/ "Go See the Dots!")

I am facinated by Artificial Intelegence (AI).  OpenAI's [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) has been gaining a lot of popularity lately.  I wanted to see what we could build togehter.  I had an idea in my head of creating a React App that was covered in squrares that changed to a random color at random time intervals.  Since I just "went for it" in a prompt => copy and paste frenzy I wasn't following proper git flow so my initial commit is a major portion of the project completed.  I have added some of the chat I had with GPT3 in order to co-write Party Dots
