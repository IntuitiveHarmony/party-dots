# React-Dots

I am facinated by Artificial Intelegence (AI).  OpenAI's [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) has been gaining a lot of popularity lately.  I wanted to see what we could build togehter.  I had an idea in my head of creating a React App that was covered in squrares that changed to a random color at random time intervals.  Since I just "went for it" in a prompt => copy and paste frenzy I wasn't following proper gitFlow so my initial commit is a major portion of the project completed.  I will go back through my conversation with chatGPT and commit the different versions along with some comments in the code so you can see how the code progressed.  I will also share some of my insights in the process and whart I learned.
