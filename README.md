# Party-Dots

[Live Site](https://intuitiveharmony.github.io/party-dots/ "Go See the Dots!")

I am facinated by Artificial Intelegence.  OpenAI's [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) has been gaining a lot of popularity lately.  I wanted to see what we could build togehter.  I had an idea of creating a React App that was covered in squrares that changed to a random color at random time intervals.  Since I just "went for it" in a prompt => copy and paste frenzy I wasn't following proper git flow so my initial commit is a major portion of the project completed.  I have added some of the chat I had with GPT3 in order to co-write Party Dots 

<br />

## GPT Co-Create-React-App

In this project I wanted to take more of a back seat role and see what chatGPT could create based solely on me inputing prompts into the chat bot describing what I was trying to put together.  To be clear: `most of this code was copy pasted from chatGPT` There were a few times that I interviened because the bot was unable to complete what I was trying to accomplish although I still tried to exaust my attempts to solve it within the chat prompts rather than simply changeing the code itself.

> GPT - Hello! How may I assist you today?<br />ME - make a react app page that has small divs that individually change color randomly
