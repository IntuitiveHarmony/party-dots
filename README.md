## <img src="./public/favicon.ico" width="18em" class="filter1"/> GPT Co-Create-React-App

In this project I wanted to take more of a back seat role and see what OpenAI's [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) could create based solely on me inputing prompts into the chat bot describing what I was trying to put together.  I had an idea of creating a React App that was a page covered in squrares that changed to a random color at random time intervals. 

To be clear: most of this code was generated by chatGPT 

### What Does that Mean?

- There are many parts of this project that I would have approached differently had I coded it on my own
- There are a few lines of code in here that I don't completely understand at the moment
- There were a few times that I interviened because the bot was unable to complete what I was trying to accomplish although I still tried to exaust my attempts to solve it within the chat prompts rather than simply changeing the code itself. 
 
With this project the focus was more or less having fun and exploring what chatGPT was capeable of plus examine some of the interactions and challenges I had with the program.

Let's go! ‚ö°

<br />

## <img src="./public/favicon.ico" width="18em"/> Set Up

To begin, I initilized a react app and deleted the boilerplate code contained within the `app.js` and `app.css` files.  From there I started imputing prompts into GPT.  Since I just "went for it" in a <kbd>prompt</kbd> => <kbd>copy</kbd> + <kbd>paste</kbd> <kbd>frenzy!!!</kbd> I wasn't following proper git flow so my initial commit is a major portion of the project completed (sorry, octocat).  Therefore, I have included some of my prompts and the code that was produced by GPT3 in the process of co-writing Party Dots.  If you are really curious you can explore [party-dots2](), where I made another repo I made so I could get the neccessary screenschots for this write up.

## <img src="./public/favicon.ico" width="18em"/> The Prompts Begin

While I am very polite I real life and with humans, I chose to be as direct as I could as to not give the bot exteranerous information while asking it to complete a task.  I would however express gratitude and let the program know when the desired code was achieved.

*prompt 1*
> GPT - Hello! How may I assist you today?<br /><br/>ME - make a react app page that has small divs that individually change color randomly<br /><br/>GPT - Sure! Here's an example of a React component that generates small divs with random colors:

<br />

Once I ran the [code](https://github.com/IntuitiveHarmony/party-dots2/blob/0681ba0da97d2cedf1a27729d617f4fd9049e49c/src/App.js) that it gave me I ended up with a large handful of randomly colored squares that would change to random colors once they were clicked. Not quite what I was going for but hey, Rome wasn't built in a day either.

It also gave me an explination of the code it provided, which I didn't read, beacuse, as I stated earlier, I was trapped in a üå™Ô∏è of <kbd>prompt</kbd> => <kbd>copy</kbd> + <kbd>pasting</kbd>   

I did however, include them in the code as comments if you are interested in reading what chatGPT had to say about its own code.

*prompt 2*
> ME - Can you make it so the page is covered with boxes and they change colors on their own rather than a click<br/><br/>GPT - Sure! Here's an updated [version](https://github.com/IntuitiveHarmony/party-dots2/blob/9b74ebe8d28bca15210b4cbd2c4a76b0b34ebe49/src/App.js) of the component that generates boxes that automatically change colors:

<br/>

I had a couple of issues with this output:

- All of the squares were at the top of the page.
- All of the squares were changing colors at the same time

I knew that we needed to address these problems one at a time üîß

*prompt 3*
> ME - Can you make it so the boxes change at random time intervals rather than at all the same time<br/><br/>GPT - Sure! Here's an updated [version](https://github.com/IntuitiveHarmony/party-dots2/blob/ef2c7ce652c224bc41a17110f78db338c137ada4/src/App.js) of the component that generates boxes that change colors at random intervals:

<br/>

The Intervals were happening closer to what I had originaly invisioned.  Let's work on the squares taking up the whole page now.
